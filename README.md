What is it?
This a simple yet complex arithmetic arranger!

How to use it?
Call the function with the named parameters!

Skill?
First public project on GitHub and as of the time writing I'm really just started python!
I have started learning seriously about 2024 june.
The coding is very unorganised and scuffed but it works right?

Copied?
No. I can honestly say that this was all done by me! No copy and pasting from coding websites or ai models

Limits
Sadly this only works with addition and subtraction
